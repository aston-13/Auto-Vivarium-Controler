## Background
I wanted to create a auto control viarium system that I did not have to monitor 24/7 and tend to all change from daylight to night for my Mom. It started out as a project to monitor the humidity. I want to maintain the right temperature and humidity for the plants. I detect temperature and humidity by sensors to control the humidifier and plant light.
